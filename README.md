Using logistic regression and decision trees to develop a profile of the typical customer that purchases organic products./n
The Business Scenario:  
A supermarket is offering a new line of organic products.  The supermarketâ€™s management wants to determine which customers are most likely to purchase these products and develop a profile of the typical customer that purchases organic products.
As a side issue, they would also like to understand whether customers that purchase organic products spend more (or less) on average than other customers.  If they find that customers who purchase organic products are also highly profitable customers, that makes the additional cost of stocking organic products more palatable for the management.
